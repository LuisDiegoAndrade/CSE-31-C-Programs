# CSE-31-C-Programs

In Addition to compiling to Mach-O 64-bit executables (I'm on OSX) I will use the open source tool, Emscripten, to produce WebAssembly from my C source files. Emscripten handles a lot of things I dont quite know how to do yet such as using the WebAssembly JavaScript API. I'll be using python3 and the flask micro framework to serve the WASM binary codes. I generate the pdfs using LaTeX on overleaf.com. There is some python scripts that generate these .tex files.
